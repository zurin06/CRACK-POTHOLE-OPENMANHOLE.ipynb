# Road Crack Detection using YOLOv8 ðŸš§

This project implements **YOLOv8m, YOLOv8, and MGB-YOLO** for detecting road cracks, potholes, and open manholes.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detects road damages using deep learning.
- Trained on a custom dataset.
- Uses **PyTorch** and **YOLOv8** for detection.

## ðŸš€ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurin06/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
